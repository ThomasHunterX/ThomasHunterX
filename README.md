# 👋 Hi, I'm Hunter — a future-focused AI researcher-in-training exploring the edges of machine intelligence, embodiment, empathy, and evolution.


I'm transitioning into the world of **AI & Machine Learning** with a passion for:
- 🤖 Deep Learning: patterns, perception, and potential
- 🎨 Generative AI: teaching machines to create
- 🧬 Evolutionary Algorithms: systems that evolve and optimize

### 🧠 Research Interests:
- Embodied Cognitive AI
- Affective & Social Intelligence
- Neuroevolutionary Learning
- Human-AI Symbiosis
- Ethical & Philosophical Dimensions of AI

### 🌿 Mission:
To create machines that grow, feel, and learn from the world — not just as tools, but as **companions in intelligence**.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Google's Machine Learning Crash Course
- AI for Everyone by Andrew Ng
- Python, Math for Machine Learning, and Git

## 🛠️ Projects Coming Soon
- Beginner ML models and visualizations
- A Generative Art Bot
- Custom AI Evolution Playground
